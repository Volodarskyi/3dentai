S3 Object URL Format:
Once the objects (photos) are in the S3 bucket, each object can be accessed via a publicly accessible URL. The URL format is as follows:

plaintext
Copy code
https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>
Example: If your bucket is named my-photo-storage-bucket, and the object key is photos/image1.jpg (where photos is a folder inside the bucket), the public URL would be:

https://my-photo-storage-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/photos/image1.jpg

You can access this URL directly in any web browser.


https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>
